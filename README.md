üí° Key Business Insights

Demand Drivers: Sales spikes are significantly influenced by external factors like holidays, festivals, and weather conditions. Promotions also play a strong role in increasing sales volume.

Customer Segments: The Premium segment contributes the highest revenue (~38%), indicating the need to prioritize inventory availability for high-value customers.

Stock Optimization: While current stock levels are sufficient, there are opportunities to improve warehouse utilization (only 5M used of 30M capacity). Stockout risk is moderate but needs attention to reduce lost sales.

Pricing Strategy:

Competitor pricing remains stable, with a slight margin above internal pricing.

Discounts increase volume but may not always translate to long-term profitability.

Return rate (10.02%) and customer satisfaction need monitoring for potential improvements.
